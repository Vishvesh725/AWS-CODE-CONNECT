# aws code connect
Cloud computing service is used to deploy the web app and mobile app.
# Description for the Code
This Python script uses **Boto3**, the AWS SDK for Python, to automate the process of launching an Amazon EC2 instance. Below is a breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Setup AWS Client**:  
   The `boto3.client('ec2')` initializes an EC2 client to interact with AWS. The `region_name` specifies the region where the EC2 instance will be launched (e.g., `us-east-1`).

2. **Run Instances**:  
   The `run_instances()` method is used to launch one or more EC2 instances with the following parameters:
   - `ImageId`: Specifies the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to use (e.g., Amazon Linux 2).
   - `InstanceType`: Defines the instance size (e.g., `t2.micro`, free tier eligible).
   - `KeyName`: Specifies the name of the key pair for SSH access to the instance.
   - `SecurityGroupIds`: The security group ID to define instance-level firewall rules.
   - `SubnetId`: Specifies the subnet ID for networking within the VPC.
   - `TagSpecifications`: Adds a tag (`Name=MyEC2Instance`) to the instance for easier identification.

3. **Print Instance Details**:  
   Once the instance is launched, its details (e.g., Instance ID, state, private IP address) are retrieved and displayed.

# Use Case
This script is ideal for developers or DevOps engineers who want to programmatically:
- Spin up EC2 instances as part of their infrastructure automation.
- Deploy compute resources on demand for testing or development purposes.

# Prerequisites
Before running this script, ensure you:
- Have valid AWS credentials configured.
- Use an existing key pair, security group, and subnet.
